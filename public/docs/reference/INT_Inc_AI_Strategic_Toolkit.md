### 1. Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

INT Inc. has built a strong foundation with Microsoft 365 and Copilot for internal data security and searchability. However, 70% of Fortune 500 companies now deploy AI, and 87% of MSPs report significant AI knowledge gaps. The competitive window is 6-18 months before AI becomes table stakes.

### The Capability Gap

While Copilot excels as a Librarian (searching and organizing internal data), it isn't always the best Analyst or Coder. Competitors using specialized tools like Perplexity for real-time market research or Claude for complex code generation are moving faster.

### The Solution: Hybrid Intelligence

Microsoft Copilot: Internal data (SharePoint, Teams, Outlook) - the secure foundation

### Claude Enterprise: Complex reasoning, technical documentation, code review

### Perplexity Pro: Real-time research, vendor intelligence, market analysis

### ChatGPT/Gemini: Creative content, client communications, specialized workflows

### The Numbers

### 2. The Elevator Pitch Script

Use this script when you stand up to present Slide 1. It establishes you as a forward-thinking partner, not just a complainer.

### Opening (30 seconds)

"Good morning/afternoon. Thank you for the time.

We all know AI is shifting the landscape. Right now, INT Inc. has a strong foundation with Microsoft 365 and Copilot. It's excellent for keeping our internal data secure and searchable."

### The Problem (45 seconds)

"However, as I've been digging into our workflows across the company, I've noticed a 'Capability Gap.' While Copilot is a great Librarian, it isn't always the best Analyst or Coder.

Competitors who are using tools like Perplexity for real-time market research, or Claude for complex code generation, are moving faster than us. They are getting answers in seconds that take us minutes or hours."

### The Solution (30 seconds)

"My goal today isn't to replace Copilot—it's to diversify our toolkit. I want to show you how a low-cost, high-security pilot program can help us reclaim about 15% of our team's time for higher-value work.

### Let's look at the numbers."

### Key Phrases to Emphasize

### "Diversify our toolkit" - Not replacing, adding options

### "Capability Gap" - Technical term that sounds strategic

### "Librarian vs. Analyst" - Memorable metaphor

### "Low-cost, high-security" - Addresses two biggest concerns upfront

### 3. Objection Battle Card

Executives will interrupt you. Here are the top objections and exactly how to respond without sounding defensive.

## Objection 1

### "We already pay for Copilot. Why should we pay for more tools?"

Your Response:

"That's a great point on cost. Think of Copilot like a General Practitioner doctor—essential for general health. But sometimes you need a Specialist.

For complex coding or deep market research, Copilot often hallucinates or gets stuck. For just $20/month, a 'Specialist' tool like Claude can save an engineer 5 hours. The ROI on that $20 is instant."

Key Data Point: Claude Pro at $20/month = 5 hours saved per engineer = $250+ value at $50/hr loaded cost

## Objection 2

"I'm worried about security. I don't want company data on Google or Anthropic servers."

Your Response:

"I agree 100%. That is why the Data Triage Matrix is the core of this proposal.

We are strictly prohibiting Client PII in these new tools. We will only use them for non-sensitive tasks like code syntax, public market research, and generic drafting. Secure data stays in Microsoft. Speed goes to the others."

Key Data Point: All recommended platforms (Claude, Perplexity) have SOC 2 Type II certification and zero data retention policies

## Objection 3

### "This sounds complicated to manage. We don't want Shadow IT."

Your Response:

"Actually, 'Shadow IT' is happening right now. People are likely using personal ChatGPT accounts because they need the help.

By sanctioning a Pilot Program, we bring that activity into the light, govern it, and actually see what works. It gives us control back, rather than losing it."

Key Data Point: Industry surveys show 60-70% of employees use unauthorized AI tools. Sanctioned pilots reduce risk.

### 4. Data Triage Matrix

This is the governance framework that makes the proposal possible. It addresses security concerns by clearly defining what data goes where.

### The Core Principle

SECURE DATA stays in Microsoft. SPEED goes to the specialists.

### 5. Department ROI Quick Reference

### EXECUTIVE BRIEFING: AI Toolkit Diversification Proposal

### The Problem

Over-reliance on a single AI vendor (Microsoft) creates blind spots in research and coding efficiency. While Copilot excels at internal data retrieval, it underperforms in real-time market research, complex reasoning tasks, and specialized code generation. Competitors leveraging multi-platform AI strategies are achieving 20-40% faster delivery times.

### The Solution

A "Hybrid Intelligence" model using complementary AI tools:

### Microsoft Copilot (Internal): Secure data, M365 integration, SharePoint search

Perplexity (Research): Real-time market intelligence, vendor analysis, competitive research

### Claude (Reasoning): Complex documentation, code review, compliance analysis

### The Pilot

A proposed 30-day test with 5 users across IT, InfoSec, and Marketing to measure efficiency gains. Metrics include time-to-resolution, documentation quality scores, and user satisfaction ratings.

### The Ask

### Approval for a $500 pilot budget (5 licenses x $20/month x 5 months)

### Provisional policy update to allow approved AI tools for non-PII tasks

### 30-day review checkpoint to assess ROI and expand or terminate

### Expected Outcomes

### 15-22% productivity improvement in pilot departments

### Validated use cases for company-wide rollout

### Reduced Shadow IT risk through sanctioned tool usage

### Foundation for AI Your BI℠ service enhancement

### 7. Next Steps & Pilot Proposal

### 30-Day Pilot Structure

### Week 1: Tool provisioning, user training, baseline metrics capture

### Week 2-3: Active usage period with daily feedback collection

### Week 4: ROI analysis, report generation, expansion recommendation

### Pilot Participants (Recommended)

### 2 IT Services technicians (ticket triage, documentation)

### 1 InfoSec analyst (compliance documentation, policy review)

### 1 Marketing specialist (content creation, campaign analysis)

### 1 Operations team member (SOP creation, process documentation)

### Success Metrics

### Budget Request

### Total Pilot Investment: $500 (5 licenses x $20/month x 5 months)
