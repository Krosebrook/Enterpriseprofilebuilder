# ENTERPRISE PRESENTATION ROADMAP
## Phase 1–3 with 5 Subphases Each (15 Total Milestones)

**Goal:** Transform your audited narrative anchor into a complete, delivery-ready enterprise presentation on Claude AI for organizational development  
**Timeline:** 2–3 weeks for full delivery-ready state  
**Audience:** OD Managers, HR leaders, organizational development professionals  
**Presentation Length:** 60 minutes (including demos and Q&A)

---

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION & CREDIBILITY
### "Lock Down Your Story and Proof Points"
**Duration:** 3–5 days  
**Goal:** Record, refine, and validate your opening narrative; establish proof points  

---

### **SUBPHASE 1.1: Narrative Recording & Iteration**

**What You'll Do:**
1. Record yourself reading the audited narrative anchor (3–4 min) using:
   - Voice memo app (iPhone/Android) or
   - Desktop recorder (QuickTime, OBS) or
   - Zoom (for better quality)
   
2. Listen back and score on:
   - Pacing (not too fast, not too slow)
   - Energy (natural, not monotone)
   - Emotional beats (pause after "O'Toole's," "Kinsley," "exponential")
   - Pronunciation (especially "Claude," "INT Inc.")

3. Re-record 2–3 times until you sound natural (not rehearsed)

4. Share best version with trusted colleague for feedback ("Does this feel authentic?")

**Deliverable:**
- ✅ Final 3–4 minute audio recording (MP4 or MP3)
- ✅ Written notes on pacing/emphasis

**Success Metric:**
- Recording feels conversational, not scripted
- Key emotional beats land naturally
- No "umms" or long pauses (edit if needed)

**Time Investment:** 30–45 minutes

---

### **SUBPHASE 1.2: Proof Point Verification & Screenshots**

**What You'll Do:**
1. Gather evidence for each claim in your narrative:
   - **AI Master Reference** (980-line doc) → Export as PDF, screenshot key sections
   - **R-I-S-E & F-L-O-W frameworks** → Create 1-slide visual for each
   - **Platform Explorer v3.1 / INT Smart Triage AI 2.0** → Record 60-second screen walkthrough
   - **Kinsley's voice-to-illustrated-book app** → Screenshot or brief video demo (1–2 min)
   - **Prompting frameworks** → Create reference sheet with 3 examples

2. Organize in a folder: `/Presentation_Assets/Proof_Points/`

3. Create a simple index document listing what you have + any gaps

**Deliverable:**
- ✅ Screenshot gallery (10–15 images)
- ✅ 60-second screen recording (Platform Explorer)
- ✅ 1–2 minute app demo (Kinsley's app)
- ✅ Proof point index document

**Success Metric:**
- Every claim in your narrative has visual evidence
- Screenshots are high-quality (readable, not blurry)
- Demos run smoothly without technical hiccups

**Time Investment:** 1–2 hours

---

### **SUBPHASE 1.3: Artifact Polish & Branding**

**What You'll Do:**
1. Review all proof point artifacts for visual consistency:
   - Font sizes (readable in presentation)
   - Color palette (professional, not chaotic)
   - Naming conventions (clear, organized)

2. Create a simple "Title Slide" template:
   - Your name + role + "Claude AI for Organizational Development"
   - INT Inc. logo + date
   - High-quality background (not distracting)

3. Decide: Will you show live demos or pre-recorded?
   - **Live demos** = more engaging but higher risk
   - **Pre-recorded** = safer, more polished
   - Recommend: **Pre-recorded key demos + 1 live if confident**

4. Test all videos/GIFs/interactions on the device you'll present from (laptop, iPad, etc.)

**Deliverable:**
- ✅ Title slide template
- ✅ Consistent artifact folder
- ✅ Demo video list (pre-recorded vs. live decision matrix)

**Success Metric:**
- All visuals match aesthetic (not a mishmash)
- Videos play without lag or artifacts
- You feel confident with visual consistency

**Time Investment:** 1 hour

---

### **SUBPHASE 1.4: Objection & Question Prep**

**What You'll Do:**
1. Anticipate 5–7 objections OD managers will raise:
   - "But we already use ChatGPT. Why Claude?"
   - "How is this different from AI adoption initiatives we've tried?"
   - "What about data privacy with sensitive employee info?"
   - "How long until ROI?"
   - "Won't this replace people?"
   - "Which role should we start with?"
   - "What's the total cost of ownership?"

2. For each, draft:
   - Your 30-second answer (conversational, not defensive)
   - 2–3 supporting facts/sources
   - 1 concrete example from your experience

- ✅ Talking points (30-second answers)
- ✅ Supporting sources / citations

**Success Metric:**
- You can answer each objection confidently without notes
- Answers feel conversational (not canned)
- You reference your own experience, not just theory

**Time Investment:** 1.5 hours

---

### **SUBPHASE 1.5: Messaging Hierarchy & Talking Points Sheet**

**What You'll Do:**
1. Create a one-page reference sheet (for you, not the audience):

```
TOP-LEVEL MESSAGING HIERARCHY:

1. TL;DR (1 sentence)
   "Claude is a thinking platform, not a tool—and it accelerates 
    organizational learning when integrated across all five surfaces."

- ✅ Visual timing map (one-pager)
- ✅ Proof point placement guide ("Demo 1 uses Platform Explorer screenshot")

**Success Metric:**
- Timeline adds up to 60 minutes
- Clear transitions between sections
- Every section has a clear "why" (why this content here?)

**Time Investment:** 1.5 hours

---

### **SUBPHASE 2.2: Speaker Notes & Transition Scripts**

**What You'll Do:**
1. For each section in your architecture, write:
   - **Opening sentence** (how you transition in)
   - **2–3 key talking points** (what you'll say)
   - **Closing line** (how you transition out)
   - **Timing note** (how long to spend here)

2. Example format:

```
SECTION: ECOSYSTEM MAP > Web (2 minutes)

OPENING TRANSITION:
"So I've shown you where I've been. Now let me show you where 
I am *now*—using Claude across five entirely different platforms. 
Each one teaches me the same intelligence in a different context. 
Let's start with the web."

KEY TALKING POINTS:
1. Web is where most people start—Projects, Artifacts, multi-turn reasoning
2. But web isn't the only place. It's just the first place.
3. [SHOW: Screenshot of Projects interface]
4. "Here's where research becomes collaborative. Here's where I iterate."

SUPPORTING VISUALS:
- Projects screenshot (collaborating on OD research)
- One artifact example (engagement survey design)

CLOSING TRANSITION:
"Web is powerful for thinking together. But when I went to desktop, 
that's when things got interesting."

TIMING: 2 minutes (tight; don't go over)
```

3. Write these for all 8 sections (opening, ecosystem, methodology, superpowers, demos, governance, pilots, closing)

4. Create a master "Speaker Notes" document (Google Doc or Word)

**Deliverable:**
- ✅ Speaker notes for all 8 sections (with opening/closing transitions)
- ✅ Timing annotations for each
- ✅ Visual placement guide ("What screenshot goes here?")

**Success Metric:**
- Each section has a clear transition in and out
- Talking points are conversational (not robotic)
- You can read notes and deliver naturally (not recite)

**Time Investment:** 2–2.5 hours

---

### **SUBPHASE 2.3: Demo Scripts & Contingency Plans**

**What You'll Do:**
1. For each of your 4 demos, create a script:

**Demo 1: Web (RTO Sentiment Analysis)**
- What you're showing: How Claude synthesizes engagement data
- Setup: Load a sample employee survey response (anonymized)
- Steps: Ask Claude to analyze, show the synthesis, discuss implications
- Time: 5 minutes
- Fallback: Pre-recorded video (if live fails)

**Demo 2: Desktop (Personalized Coaching)**
- What you're showing: How desktop extensions pull HRIS data → Claude generates coaching
- Setup: Show a mock employee profile (first name + role only)
- Steps: Voice request → Claude synthesizes → coaching appears
- Time: 5 minutes
- Fallback: Animated GIF showing the flow

**Demo 3: Mobile Voice (Workshop Synthesis)**
- What you're showing: Real-time voice → Claude organizes thinking
- Setup: Record yourself dictating feedback from a workshop
- Steps: Play voice → Claude generates summary → show output
- Time: 4 minutes
- Fallback: Pre-recorded audio + text output

**Demo 4: CLI (Bulk Employee Processing)**
- What you're showing: One command → 500 assessments processed
- Setup: Show the command, explain what it does
- Steps: Run it, show output (structured JSON)
- Time: 4 minutes (mostly showing results, not waiting for it to run)
- Fallback: Screenshot of output + explanation

2. For each demo, create a "risk mitigation" plan:

```
Demo 1 Risk: Audio/video sync issues during live Q&A
Mitigation: Pre-record the demo; pause for live questions after showing recording

Demo 2 Risk: HRIS data privacy concerns raised
Mitigation: Use fully anonymized mock data; emphasize RLS security model

Demo 3 Risk: Ambient noise during voice recording (in presentation room)
Mitigation: Use pre-recorded audio; explain "In a live setting, you'd speak naturally"

Demo 4 Risk: Internet connectivity issues
Mitigation: Pre-generate output; show screenshot with live terminal side-by-side
```

3. Create a "Demo Checklist" (print this, bring to presentation):
   - [ ] All videos loaded and tested on presentation device
   - [ ] Audio levels checked
   - [ ] WiFi backup ready (hotspot, offline version)
   - [ ] Timing rehearsed (don't run over)
   - [ ] Transition scripts memorized

**Deliverable:**
- ✅ Detailed scripts for all 4 demos (steps, timing, visuals)
- ✅ Risk mitigation plan for each
- ✅ Pre-recorded backups for 4 demos
- ✅ Demo checklist (printable)

**Success Metric:**
- Each demo has a clear "why" and "what"
- Fallback videos are high-quality (not obviously pre-recorded)
- You've practiced timing; demos don't run over
- You feel confident running demos live (or showing pre-recorded)

**Time Investment:** 2–3 hours

---

### **SUBPHASE 2.4: Slide Deck (Minimal, Textless)**

**What You'll Do:**
1. Decide on slide tool:
   - **Keynote** (Mac, polished, animated)
   - **Google Slides** (collaborative, accessible, simple)
   - **Canva** (beautiful, less technical)
   - Recommendation: **Keynote or Google Slides** (familiar, professional)

2. Create slides following these principles:
   - **Minimal text** (titles only, no paragraphs)
   - **High-quality visuals** (proof points from 1.2)
   - **One idea per slide** (not overwhelming)
   - **Consistent branding** (from 1.3 artifacts)

3. Slide structure (rough count):

```
Slide 1: Title (your name + topic)
Slide 2: Agenda (section overview)

OPENING (1 slide)
Slide 3: Narrative anchor (just your name + key stat)

   - Deliver to an imaginary audience (or better: a real person if possible)
   - Use actual slide deck + speaker notes
   - Include all 4 demos (live or pre-recorded)
   - Manage your own Q&A (time-box to 8 min)

3. Record the rehearsal (video or audio)

4. After, score yourself on:
   - **Clarity:** Did I explain concepts well?
   - **Pacing:** Did I rush or drag?
   - **Energy:** Did I sound engaged?
   - **Confidence:** Did I stumble on any sections?
   - **Timing:** Did I finish in 60 minutes?

5. Revise speaker notes based on what actually works vs. what feels clunky

6. Identify 2–3 "weak spots" and practice those sections again

7. Do a second rehearsal (40 minutes, focused run-through)

**Deliverable:**
- ✅ Recorded rehearsal (video or audio)
- ✅ Self-assessment notes (clarity, pacing, energy, confidence, timing)
- ✅ Revised speaker notes (incorporating what you learned)
- ✅ Second rehearsal recording (tighter, more confident)

**Success Metric:**
- First rehearsal: 60–70 minutes (tight timing, some stumbles okay)
- Second rehearsal: 55–62 minutes (confident, natural flow)
- You can answer your own objections in Q&A section
- You feel ready to present (not terrified)

**Time Investment:** 2.5 hours (including 2 full run-throughs)

   - **Company size:** Startup (10–50)? Mid-market (100–500)? Enterprise (500+)?
   - **Industry:** Tech, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, other?
   - **Current AI maturity:** None? ChatGPT users? Exploring implementation?
   - **Pain points:** Engagement? Retention? Training? Change management?

2. Customize 3 elements based on audience:

   **A) Opening narrative (optional tweak)**
   - If audience is tech-heavy: Lean into architecture/integration language
   - If audience is HR-focused: Lean into people/culture/learning language
   - If audience is mixed: Keep current version (balanced)

   **B) OD-specific examples in each section**
   - Survey existing audience members (if possible) for their biggest OD challenges
   - Reference 1–2 specific challenges in your "Superpowers" section
   - Example: "If you're struggling with engagement diagnosis like [Company X was], here's how Claude cuts the timeline from 3 weeks to 5 days"

   **C) Closing ask (customize to org)**
   - If they're a consultancy: "Let's run a joint pilot on employee engagement"
   - If they're an enterprise: "Let's start with three pilots: leadership development, change readiness, succession planning"
   - If they're a startup: "Let's integrate Claude into your first OD operating model"

3. Create a "Customization Checklist":

```

- It includes concrete next steps (not just theory)
- Links work; no typos

**Time Investment:** 1–1.5 hours

---

### **SUBPHASE 3.3: Tech Setup & Contingency Testing**

**What You'll Do:**
1. **Device setup** (the laptop/device you'll present from):
   - [ ] All slide deck files saved in 2 locations (cloud + local)
   - [ ] All demo videos downloaded (not relying on internet)
   - [ ] Screen zoom at 125% (readable for audience, not too big)
   - [ ] Notifications OFF (mute Slack, email, calendar)
   - [ ] Battery fully charged + power cable nearby
   - [ ] Speaker notes app open (not visible to audience projector)

2. **Presentation software testing**:
   - [ ] Open slide deck; click through all slides
   - [ ] Test animation/transitions (if you use them)
   - [ ] Confirm videos play within slides (or externally on separate window)
   - [ ] Check that speaker notes display correctly (on your device only)
   - [ ] Test screen sharing on Zoom/Teams (if virtual)

3. **Demo testing** (each of 4 demos):
   - [ ] Demo 1 (Web): Load Claude interface, test Projects feature
   - [ ] Demo 2 (Desktop): Open desktop app, confirm extension loads
   - [ ] Demo 3 (Mobile): Have phone/tablet ready, test voice input
   - [ ] Demo 4 (CLI): Open terminal, confirm command format, pre-generate output
   - Time each demo (don't go over 5 min per)

4. **Contingency tests** (if main setup fails):
   - [ ] Have pre-recorded versions of all 4 demos (video files, not live)
   - [ ] Have PDF backup of slide deck (in case software crashes)
   - [ ] Have audio backup of your narrative (in case you freeze up)
   - [ ] Have internet backup: hotspot from phone (in case wifi dies)
   - [ ] Have offline version of key materials (PDFs, docs)

5. **Venue/platform testing** (24 hours before):
   - **If in-person:**
     - [ ] Visit room; test projector + audio
     - [ ] Confirm wifi is stable (speed test)
     - [ ] Check lighting (can people see you + screen?)
     - [ ] Confirm speaker remote/pointer works
   - **If virtual (Zoom/Teams):**
     - [ ] Join 5 min early; test video/audio
     - [ ] Confirm screen sharing works (practice switching between slides + demos)
     - [ ] Test breakout room (if you plan to use for Q&A)
     - [ ] Have participant link + recording settings ready

6. **Create a "Tech Troubleshooting Sheet"** (keep nearby during presentation):

```
IF WIFI DIES:
1. Switch to phone hotspot (already set up)
2. Skip live demos; play pre-recorded videos instead
3. Continue presentation (momentum matters)

IF PROJECTOR FAILS:
1. Present from your laptop screen only (ask audience to come closer if needed)
2. Or: Project from iPad/phone to secondary screen (if available)

IF SLIDES CRASH:
1. Switch to PDF backup (already downloaded)
2. Or: Present from speaker notes on your device (explain to audience)

IF AUDIO FAILS:
1. Use phone mic / laptop speakers as backup
2. Speak louder; ask audience if they can hear
3. Continue (don't get flustered)

IF DEMO VIDEO FAILS:
1. Play pre-recorded backup (already downloaded)
2. Or: Describe the demo + show screenshot
3. Note: "Normally this demo runs live, but X happened..."

IF YOU BLANK ON TALKING POINTS:
1. Pause; take a breath; look at speaker notes on your device
2. Say: "Let me pull up my notes for a second"
3. Recovery is normal; audience won't judge
```

**Deliverable:**
- ✅ Checklist of all tech setup (device, software, demos, contingencies)

   - [ ] Get good sleep (not staying up late cramming)
   - [ ] Review speaker notes 1x (not obsessively)
   - [ ] Do a 10-minute "energy run-through" (just speak through key sections, no slides)
   - [ ] Pack: power cable, clicker, water bottle, printed notes, tech sheet
   - [ ] Confirm all logistics: time, location, attendee count, agenda

2. **Day of presentation (morning):**
   - [ ] Eat a good breakfast (not too heavy, not too light)
   - [ ] Drink water (stay hydrated)
   - [ ] Dress in clothes that make you feel confident (not brand new, already tested)
   - [ ] Arrive 30 min early (in-person) or 15 min early (virtual)

3. **30 minutes before**:
   - [ ] Do a final tech check (projector, audio, wifi, videos)
   - [ ] Review speaker notes 1 more time (not the whole thing, just glance)
   - [ ] Do the "4-count breath": Breathe in (4), hold (4), out (4), hold (4) — 3x
   - [ ] Remind yourself: "I've practiced this. I know this content. I can do this."

4. **5 minutes before**:
   - [ ] Stand, stretch, loosen shoulders
   - [ ] Open slide deck; cue up to Slide 1
   - [ ] Silence notifications (one more time)
   - [ ] Test audio/video one last time
   - [ ] Make eye contact with a few friendly faces in audience (if in-person)

5. **Mental reframes:**
   - **If nervous:** "This nervousness is energy. I'm ready to share something I care about."
   - **If you blank:** "That's fine. I'll pause, look at my notes, and continue. No one will judge."
   - **If a demo fails:** "I have a backup. Audience won't know the difference. Keep going."
   - **If audience is quiet:** "That's normal. They're thinking. I don't need constant feedback."

**Deliverable:**
- ✅ Pre-presentation checklist (physical, mental, tech)
- ✅ Day-of timeline (with 30-min, 5-min, 1-min pre-game)
- ✅ Mental reframe cue cards (print these, keep in pocket)

**Success Metric:**
- You feel calm (not relaxed, but centered)
- All logistics are confirmed
- Tech is tested one final time
- You feel ready to present

**Time Investment:** 1 hour (day before) + 45 min (day of)

### **SUBPHASE 3.5: Post-Presentation & Iteration Loop**

**What You'll Do:**
1. **Immediately after presentation** (while it's fresh):
   - [ ] Collect any business cards / contact info from interested audience members
   - [ ] Take note of questions you got (for future customization)
   - [ ] Note which demos landed best (for future iterations)
   - [ ] Write down any tech issues or timing problems

2. **Within 24 hours** (before you forget):
   - [ ] Send thank-you email to attendees (reference something specific from Q&A)
   - [ ] Include: Handout PDF + Claude resources link
   - [ ] Optional: Include link to your presentation deck (if shareable)
   - [ ] Call to action: "Let's grab 30 min to discuss a pilot" + scheduling link

3. **Within 1 week** (capture learnings):
   - [ ] Create a "Presentation Iteration Log" (what worked, what didn't):

```
WHAT WENT WELL:
• Narrative anchor landed smoothly
• Demo 1 (Web) got great reactions
• Audience questions were thoughtful
• Timing was perfect (finished in 58 min)

WHAT FELT CLUNKY:
• Transition to Superpowers section was abrupt
• Demo 2 (Desktop) had 10 sec lag (internet issue)
• Didn't use full Q&A time (could have dug deeper)

IMPROVEMENTS FOR NEXT TIME:
• Add 1 sentence transition bridge before Superpowers
• Pre-load Demo 2 locally (not from cloud)
• Plan for 5 min Q&A minimum (with prepared follow-up Qs)
• Spend more time on governance section (audience wanted more depth)

QUESTIONS I GOT:
• "How long does implementation typically take?" → Need better answer
• "Do you have a ROI calculator?" → Build one for next presentation
• "Can we start with just web + desktop?" → Add this use case to slides

FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS:
• 3 potential pilot opportunities identified → schedule calls
• 2 requests for more detail on compliance → create 1-pager
• 1 audience member wants to co-present → discuss possibility
```

4. **Optional: Record video feedback** (for your own growth):
   - [ ] Watch recording of your presentation (if you recorded it)
   - [ ] Note your best moments (moments of clarity, authentic energy)
   - [ ] Note areas to improve (rushed sections, unclear explanations)
   - [ ] Be kind to yourself (you probably did better than you think)

5. **Build an "Ongoing Customization" folder**:
   - Industry-specific examples (by vertical: tech, finance, healthcare, etc.)
   - Role-specific angles (CFO angle, CHRO angle, CTO angle)
   - Updated statistics / new features (Claude changes regularly)
   - New case studies / examples (as you accumulate them)

**Deliverable:**
- ✅ Thank-you emails (sent within 24 hours)
- ✅ Presentation iteration log (what worked, what's next)
- ✅ Video feedback notes (self-assessment)
- ✅ Customization folder (for future presentations)

**Success Metric:**
- You've followed up with attendees (not ghosted them)
- You've identified 1–2 improvements for next time
- You've collected pilot opportunities
- You have a system for capturing learnings

**Time Investment:** 2–3 hours (spread over 1 week)

## SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR LAUNCH

**You're ready to present when:**

✅ You can deliver your narrative anchor (3–4 min) without notes, naturally  
✅ You have high-quality proof points (screenshots, videos, demos)  
✅ Your slide deck is minimal, visually consistent, readable from back of room  
✅ You've rehearsed the full presentation 2x and feel confident  
✅ All 4 demos have pre-recorded backups (in case live fails)  
✅ You've tested tech 24 hours before (projector, audio, wifi, videos)  
✅ You can answer 5–7 objections confidently  
✅ You have a customized ask for the specific audience  
✅ You know what to do if something goes wrong (tech sheet)  
✅ You feel excited (not terrified) about presenting  

---

## NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTION

**Start with Phase 1.1:** Record yourself reading the audited narrative anchor (3–4 min). Don't overthink it. Just speak it out loud. Listen back. Re-record if needed.

That single action (30–45 min) will unlock the entire presentation.

**Ready?**
