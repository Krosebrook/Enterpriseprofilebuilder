## Data Analysis Tips

**Weekly Review Questions:**
1. Which task types show the highest time savings?
2. What's the average quality score across all tasks?
3. What friction points appear most frequently?
4. Which users are getting the most value?
5. Are there patterns in tasks with low reuse rates?

**Success Indicators:**
- Average quality score ≥ 3.5
- Time saved per task ≥ 30 minutes
- Reuse rate ≥ 80%
- Friction points decreasing over time

---

## Sharing Your Data

When reporting pilot results to stakeholders:

1. **Calculate totals:** Total time saved, average quality score, reuse percentage
2. **Identify top use cases:** Which task types had highest ROI?
3. **Document friction points:** What needs improvement?
4. **Share success stories:** Include 2-3 example entries with high scores
5. **Make recommendations:** Based on data, what should scale?
