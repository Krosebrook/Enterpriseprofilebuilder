## 🔗 INTEGRATION MAP

### How Everything Connects

**Foundation Layer (Week 1-4):**
- Platform Explorer v4.0 = Assessment + Platform Selection
- Security Baseline = SSO + Audit Logs + PII Policies
- Tool Procurement = Vendor Selection + Contract Negotiation

**Automation Layer (Week 5-8):**
- MCP Servers = Connect Claude to GitHub, Stripe, n8n, Figma, Notion
- Workflow Automation = Lead scoring, ticket routing, invoice processing
- Monitoring Stack = Sentry (errors) + PostHog (analytics) + Datadog (infra)

**Intelligence Layer (Week 9-12):**
- AI Features = Chatbot deflection, predictive churn, compliance automation
- Multi-Model Router = Claude (reasoning) + GPT-4 (creative) + Gemini (analysis)
- Drift Monitoring = Track model performance, alert on degradation

## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

### Top 10 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Vendor lock-in** | Medium | High | Use MCP abstraction layer, all data exportable <24hrs |
| **Security incident** | Low | Critical | SSO Day 1, quarterly audits, PII redaction SOPs |
| **Low adoption** | Medium | High | Weekly office hours, exec sponsorship, gamification |
| **Integration failure** | Medium | Medium | Week 0 spike, test all integrations, fallback to manual |
| **Customer backlash** | Low | High | Human-in-the-loop for >$10K deals, feature flags for rollback |
| **Budget overrun** | Low | Medium | Hard cap at $150K, monthly reviews, kill underperformers |
| **Model drift** | Medium | High | Drift monitoring system, monthly retraining, A/B testing |
| **Compliance violation** | Low | Critical | Legal review all tools, quarterly compliance audits |
| **Key person risk** | Medium | High | Document all processes, train 2nd-tier support, cross-train |
| **Technology obsolescence** | Low | Medium | Quarterly platform review, subscribe to vendor roadmaps |
