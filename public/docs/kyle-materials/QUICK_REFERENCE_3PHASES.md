# QUICK REFERENCE: 3 PHASES, 15 SUBPHASES
## One-Page Roadmap for Enterprise Presentation

---

## THE BIG PICTURE

You're building a **60-minute enterprise presentation on Claude AI for Organizational Development managers**. 

| Phase | Goal | Duration | Deliverable |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | Lock down your story (record, verify, prepare) | 5–6 hours | Narrative audio, proof points, objection playbook |
| **Phase 2** | Build your deck (architect slides, rehearse) | 12–15 hours | Complete slide deck + 2 rehearsals |
| **Phase 3** | Go live (customize, test, deliver) | 8–10 hours | Ready to present to real audience |
| **TOTAL** | End-to-end production-ready presentation | 25–31 hours | Confidence to present and follow up |

---

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (5–6 hours over 3–5 days)

### Five Subphases in Order:

| # | Subphase | What You Do | Time | Deliverable |
|---|----------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 1.1 | **Narrative Recording** | Record yourself reading audited narrative (3–4 min); iterate until natural | 45 min | 3–4 min audio file |
| 1.2 | **Proof Point Verification** | Gather screenshots, videos, demos (Platform Explorer, Kinsley's app, frameworks) | 1–2 hrs | Screenshot gallery + 2 demo videos |
| 1.3 | **Artifact Polish** | Create title slide template; ensure visual consistency across all materials | 1 hr | Branded artifact folder |
| 1.4 | **Objection Prep** | Write 30-second answers to 5–7 likely objections (ChatGPT vs Claude, privacy, cost, etc.) | 1.5 hrs | Response playbook document |
| 1.5 | **Messaging Hierarchy** | Create one-pager with TL;DR, key messages, stats, closing statement | 45 min | Reference sheet + crib sheet |

**Gate:** All proof points gathered; you can deliver narrative naturally without notes; you have answers to objections

---

## PHASE 2: CONTENT ARCHITECTURE (12–15 hours over 5–7 days)

### Five Subphases in Order:

| # | Subphase | What You Do | Time | Deliverable |
|---|----------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 2.1 | **Architecture** | Map 60-min presentation: 8 sections (opening, ecosystem, methodology, superpowers, demos, governance, pilots, closing) | 1.5 hrs | Section outline + timing map |
| 2.2 | **Speaker Notes** | Write opening/talking points/closing for each section with transitions | 2–2.5 hrs | Master speaker notes document |
| 2.3 | **Demo Scripts** | Create detailed scripts + risk mitigation for 4 demos; prepare pre-recorded backups | 2–3 hrs | Demo playbook + 4 backup videos |
| 2.4 | **Slide Deck** | Design 25 slides (minimal text, high-impact visuals); test on presentation device | 3–4 hrs | Polished slide deck (Keynote/Google Slides) |
| 2.5 | **Rehearsal** | Do 2 full run-throughs (60+ min each); record; refine based on what lands | 2.5 hrs | 2 rehearsal recordings + revised notes |

**Gate:** Slide deck looks professional; you've delivered full presentation 2x; timing is 55–62 minutes; you feel ready

---

## PHASE 3: DELIVERY READY (8–10 hours over 3–5 days)

### Five Subphases in Order:

| # | Subphase | What You Do | Time | Deliverable |
|---|----------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 3.1 | **Audience Customization** | Research actual audience; customize examples/ask/language to their context | 1.5–2 hrs | Customized opening + closing; audience research doc |
| 3.2 | **Handouts** | Create one-page leave-behind, 2-slide recap, optional 5-page playbook | 1–1.5 hrs | PDF handout + recap slides |
| 3.3 | **Tech Setup** | Test device, demos, contingencies; create troubleshooting sheet | 1.5–2 hrs | Tech checklist + contingency plan |
| 3.4 | **Presentation Day Prep** | Pre-presentation timeline (day before + day of); mental reframes | 1 hr (day before) + 45 min (day of) | Pre-game checklist + mental cue cards |
| 3.5 | **Post-Presentation** | Follow-up emails, iteration log, customization folder for future | 2–3 hrs (over 1 week) | Thank-you emails + improvement notes |

**Gate:** Tech is tested 24 hours before; audience is known; customizations done; contingencies ready; you feel confident

## START HERE: IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP

**Today (right now):** Do **Subphase 1.1**

**Action:** Record yourself reading the audited narrative anchor (3–4 minutes)

**How:**
1. Open your phone voice memo or computer audio recorder
2. Read `/KYLE_NARRATIVE_ANCHOR_AUDITED.md` out loud (don't overthink it)
3. Let it be natural (pauses are fine; stumbles are fixable)
4. Listen back
5. Re-record if it doesn't feel authentic (aim for 2–3 takes max)

**Time:** 30–45 minutes

**Why this first:** This single recording unlocks everything else. Once you have this, the rest of the presentation becomes much easier to build.

---

## PHASE GATE CRITERIA

### Phase 1 → Phase 2
**Ready to move on when:**
- ✅ Narrative recording sounds natural (not robotic)
- ✅ All proof points gathered + screenshots verified
- ✅ Objection playbook complete (5–7 scenarios)
- ✅ You feel confident in your story

### Phase 2 → Phase 3
**Ready to move on when:**
- ✅ Slide deck is complete + visually consistent
- ✅ You've done 2 full rehearsals (55–62 min)
- ✅ All 4 demos have backup videos (in case live fails)
- ✅ You can deliver without major stumbles

### Phase 3 → Presentation Day
**Ready to present when:**
- ✅ Audience is known; customizations done
- ✅ Tech tested 24 hours before
- ✅ All contingencies written down
- ✅ You feel excited (not terrified)

---

## TIME INVESTMENT BY PHASE

| Phase | Total Hours | Hours/Day (if spreading out) | Feasible in |
|-------|-------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | 5–6 | 1–2 hrs/day | 3–5 days |
| Phase 2 | 12–15 | 2–3 hrs/day | 5–7 days |
| Phase 3 | 8–10 | 1–2 hrs/day (most is day-of-presentation) | 3–5 days |
| **TOTAL** | **25–31** | **2–3 hrs/day average** | **3 weeks** |

---

## IF YOU'RE SHORT ON TIME

**Condensed version (2 weeks, 15–18 hours):**
- Phase 1: 3–4 hours (skip 1.5; do minimal iteration on 1.1)
- Phase 2: 8–10 hours (one rehearsal instead of two; simpler slides)
- Phase 3: 4–5 hours (basic customization; minimal post-presentation follow-up)

**Not recommended, but possible if deadline is tight.**

---

## KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

✅ **Record your narrative early** — This unlocks everything else  
✅ **Gather proof points while they're fresh** — Don't procrastinate  
✅ **Rehearse at least 2x** — First rehearsal is for learning; second is for confidence  
✅ **Test tech 24 hours before** — Not the night before, not 1 hour before  
✅ **Customize to real audience** — Generic is boring; specific resonates  
✅ **Have backup plans** — Pre-recorded demos for live demos, PDF for slides, etc.  
✅ **Follow up within 24 hours** — Strike while interest is hot  

---

## RESOURCES YOU ALREADY HAVE

✅ **Audited narrative anchor** → `/KYLE_NARRATIVE_ANCHOR_AUDITED.md`  
✅ **Full brainstorm document** → `/CLAUDE_ENTERPRISE_PRESENTATION_BRAINSTORM.md`  
✅ **Audit findings** → `/AUDIT_FINDINGS_SUMMARY.md`  
✅ **This roadmap** → `/PRESENTATION_ROADMAP_3PHASES_15SUBPHASES.md` (detailed version)  

All files are in `/outputs/` directory.

## WHAT YOU DON'T NEED

❌ **Perfect slides** — Minimal text, high-quality visuals > polished animations  
❌ **Fancy animations** — Distract from your message  
❌ **Memorized script** — Natural delivery > perfect recitation  
❌ **Every possible contingency** — Just the top 5 (wifi, projector, demo, audio, you blank)  
❌ **Hours of practice** — 2 rehearsals + 1 day-of run-through is enough  

---

## FINAL THOUGHT

You've already done the hard part: **audited your story, verified facts, built proof points**. 

The presentation itself is just packaging that story for delivery.

**Phase 1 gets you 90% of the way there.** Once you've recorded your narrative and gathered proof points, the slide deck and demos become straightforward.

**Start with Phase 1.1. You'll be amazed how much momentum builds from that one recording.**

**Status: Ready to Launch**  
**First Step: Phase 1.1 (Record Narrative)**  
**Estimated Time: 30–45 minutes**  

Go.
