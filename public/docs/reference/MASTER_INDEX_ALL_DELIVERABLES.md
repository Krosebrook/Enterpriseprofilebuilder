## TROUBLESHOOTING

**"I don't know where to start"**
→ Start with Phase 1.1. Record your narrative. Everything else flows from that.

**"I'm overwhelmed by all the steps"**
→ You don't need to do them all at once. 1–2 hours per day for 3 weeks. That's it.

**"I don't have time for all this"**
→ Do condensed version: Phase 1 (3 hrs), Phase 2 (8 hrs), Phase 3 (4 hrs) = 2 weeks, 15 hrs.

**"I'm not confident in my slides"**
→ Minimal text, high-quality visuals. Let your visuals + speaking do the work.

**"What if my presentation bombs?"**
→ You've practiced 2x. You have contingencies. Worst case: you learn for next time.

**"Do I need to memorize everything?"**
→ No. Know your story (narrative). Know your transitions. Have speaker notes for everything else.

---

---

## FINAL WORD

You have **7 complete, polished documents** and a **15-step roadmap** to take you from zero to presentation-ready in 3 weeks.

The hardest part is done: **planning and strategy**.

The rest is execution: **record, build, practice, deliver**.

**Start with Phase 1.1 today. You'll be amazed at the momentum it builds.**
