# NARRATIVE ANCHOR AUDIT REPORT
**Date:** December 11, 2025  
**Status:** CORRECTED & PUBLISHED  
**Audience:** Kyle Rosebrook (for enterprise presentation)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The original narrative anchor contained **3 major factual errors** regarding your current role and responsibilities. All have been corrected in the audited version. The rest of the narrative (background, learning journey, frameworks) remains accurate and credible.

**Impact:** The corrected version is *more* credible because it's honest about where you are *now*, not where you were planning to be.

---

## CRITICAL ERRORS FOUND & FIXED

### ❌ ERROR #1: Job Title & Role

**What Was Written:**
> "And about a year ago, I landed at Intinc as a **Staff Engineer in AppSec and Platform Engineering, supporting 50 to 200 engineers.**"

**Why It Was Wrong:**
- You're currently a **Service Tech Level 1** at INT Inc. (onboarding phase)
- INT Inc. is 45–65 total employees (not 50–200 engineers)
- You're in the **tech department** (supporting INT's service delivery operations)
- This is a *different* trajectory than the "Staff Engineer" framing

**Corrected Version:**
> "Earlier this year, I made a career transition into tech. **I just accepted a position at INT Inc. as a Service Tech Level 1, working in their tech department.** INT Inc. is a women-owned IT services firm here in Lincolnshire—25+ years in business, SOC 2 Type II certified, about 45–65 people total."

**Why This Fix Matters:**
- Honest about where you are *now*
- More relatable to OD managers (not "50–200 engineers" intimidation)
- Shows you're *learning* in your role, not already the expert
- Positions you as someone who learns fast and upskills on the job

---

### ❌ ERROR #2: Scope of Responsibility

**What Was Written:**
> "My job is to build paved roads—security frameworks, automation workflows, AI integration patterns—so engineers don't have to invent the wheel every time. This is supporting a team of 50 to 200 engineers."

**Why It Was Wrong:**
- Overstated your current responsibilities
- INT Inc. doesn't have 50–200 engineers to support
- You're building INT's *own* tech capabilities, not managing a large org

**Corrected Version:**
> "My role is to help build their technical operations while supporting their seven service delivery teams."

**Why This Fix Matters:**
- Accurate reflection of scope at a 45–65-person firm
- Shows you're a *contributor* building the foundation, not managing masses
- Makes your exponential learning even *more* impressive (you're doing this in a smaller, focused environment)

---

### ❌ ERROR #3: Framing as "Staff Engineer"

**What Was Written:**
- Multiple references to "Staff Engineer" role
- Implied you're advising dozens of engineers
- Positioned you as a platform infrastructure expert

**Why It Was Wrong:**
- You accepted a Service Tech Level 1 position (entry into IT/tech)
- You're not yet in a senior engineering role
- This is the *start* of your tech career transition, not the culmination

**Corrected Version:**
- Removed "Staff Engineer" framing entirely
- Positioned you as someone actively learning and building
- Kept focus on *learning acceleration* (which is real) rather than seniority (which doesn't match your current role)

**Why This Fix Matters:**
- Your narrative is MORE powerful when you're honest: "I'm just getting into tech, and here's how I'm accelerating my learning"
- Than when you overstate: "I'm already a senior engineer" (which creates credibility gaps)
- The exponential learning curve is MORE credible when shown in real context

## ACCURATE ELEMENTS (NO CHANGES NEEDED)

✅ **20+ years in hospitality** (O'Toole's, Walmart, Michaels)
✅ **Kinsley = daughter with voice-to-illustrated-book app**
✅ **FlashFusion = AI-powered creator SaaS in development**
✅ **980-line AI Master Reference documented**
✅ **Platform Explorer v3.1 / INT Smart Triage AI 2.0 created**
✅ **R-I-S-E and F-L-O-W frameworks developed**
✅ **Learning journey across web, desktop, mobile, CLI, API**
✅ **Exponential (not linear) learning curve**
✅ **Systems thinking from hospitality background**

---

## WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR PRESENTATION

### **Before Audit (Problem)**
- Audience thinks: "This guy is a senior engineer already. Why is he telling me about Claude?"
- Creates credibility gap: "If you're a Staff Engineer, why are you just learning Claude?"
- Overstates current position → audience distrusts the narrative

### **After Audit (Solution)**
- Audience thinks: "This person is transitioning into tech and accelerating his learning. That's exactly what I need to see."
- Creates authenticity: "He's *actually* learning this alongside us."
- Honest position → audience trusts the narrative

**Net Result:** Your story is *more* powerful, not less.

## HOW TO USE THE CORRECTED NARRATIVE

### **Delivery Checklist**

- [ ] Record yourself reading the audited narrative (3–4 minutes)
- [ ] Listen back; adjust pacing and emphasis
- [ ] Practice until it feels natural (not rehearsed)
- [ ] Focus on emotional beats, not perfection
- [ ] Pause after key moments (O'Toole's, Kinsley, "exponential")

### **Key Points to Emphasize**

1. **"I just accepted a position at INT Inc."** — Present tense. You're *in it now*.
2. **"Help build their technical operations"** — Grounded, specific, real.
3. **"That's the lens I'm bringing to Claude"** — Bridge to why your learning matters.
4. **"Exponential, not linear"** — The key insight. Let it land.
5. **"That's what I want for your organization"** — The ask, grounded in what you've actually done.

## COMPARISON: BEFORE vs. AFTER

| Aspect | Before Audit | After Audit | Why the Fix |
|--------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Job Title** | Staff Engineer, AppSec + Platform | Service Tech Level 1, Tech Dept | Honest + current |
| **Scope** | Supporting 50–200 engineers | Supporting INT's 7 service areas | Accurate + relatable |
| **Organization Size** | Implied 50–200 eng org | 45–65 total employees | Reflects reality |
| **Your Status** | Already senior | Learning + building foundation | More credible |
| **Credibility Risk** | "Why is a senior engineer just learning this?" | "This person is learning alongside us" | Builds trust |
| **OD Manager Resonance** | "He's way ahead of where we are" | "He's learning and teaching—I can follow that" | Higher engagement |

---

## FACT-CHECK SOURCES

All corrections verified against:
1. **Project Knowledge:** INT Inc. company structure, 7 service areas, 45–65 headcount
2. **Memory Records:** Service Tech Level 1 position, onboarding with HR contact Nicole
3. **Personal Context:** Kinsley, FlashFusion, 20+ years hospitality

No contradictions found. All corrections represent ground truth.

---

## WHAT STAYS THE SAME

Your three core strengths remain unchanged:

1. **Systems Thinking** — 20+ years in hospitality taught you how to scale through frameworks (REAL, STRONG)
2. **Exponential Learning** — You learned Claude across 5 platforms in a few months, compounding knowledge (REAL, STRONG)
3. **Teaching Others** — You documented frameworks (R-I-S-E, F-L-O-W, Master Reference) so others can replicate (REAL, STRONG)

The only thing that changed: **Accuracy about your current title and scope.**

And that makes the story *stronger*, not weaker.

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Read the audited narrative** (KYLE_NARRATIVE_ANCHOR_AUDITED.md)
2. **Record yourself delivering it** (3–4 minutes)
3. **Listen back and refine** (pacing, emphasis, emotional beats)
4. **Practice until natural** (not rehearsed; like you're telling a friend)
5. **Move to ecosystem section** (Part II: 5 surfaces, OD angles)

---

## FINAL NOTE

**You've now got a credible, honest, grounded narrative that positions you as:**
- Someone who understands systems (hospitality background)
- Someone who learns exponentially (Claude across 5 platforms)
- Someone who teaches others (frameworks + demonstrations)
- Someone who's *in it* (Service Tech Level 1, learning alongside your org)

That's a stronger story than "I'm already a senior engineer." Because it shows *progression*, *vulnerability*, and *real learning*.

**That's what resonates with OD managers.**
