## Comprehensive Audit & Deep Dive Report

### Current INT Inc. AI Assessment Platform vs. Option E Requirements

### Date: November 21, 2025
Status: MVP Complete → Full Feature Development Needed

## Executive Summary

The current implementation delivers a solid MVP (8-9 core features, 4 AI platforms) suitable for immediate internal use and basic client assessments. However, it falls significantly short of the full "Option E" vision required for board-level strategy and enterprise market positioning.

Current State: 50-60% of Option E requirements implemented
Board-Ready Status: Partially ready (good UX, limited strategic depth)
Market Positioning: Good for SMB/mid-market assessments, insufficient for enterprise GTM
Estimated Gap Closure Timeline: 36-45 weeks of continued development
